# Stochastic Neural ODE - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **What We've Built**

I've successfully created a **Stochastic Neural ODE** model that integrates noise directly into the vector field, making it more similar to a true Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) while maintaining the flexibility of neural networks.

## 🔬 **Key Innovation: Noise in the Vector Field**

### **Traditional Approach** (XRO & our previous Neural ODEs):
```
dx/dt = f(x, t)  [deterministic integration]
x(t) = ODESolve(f, x₀, t) + ξ(t)  [noise added post-hoc]
```

### **New Stochastic Approach**:
```
dx/dt = f(x, t) + σ(t) * ε(t)  [noise integrated into dynamics]
```

Where:
- **f(x, t)**: Deterministic neural dynamics (physics-informed)
- **σ(t)**: Learned seasonal noise amplitude
- **ε(t)**: Random noise vector sampled at each integration step

## 🧠 **Architecture Details**

### **StochasticNeuralODE Components**:

1. **StochasticODEFunc**: Main ODE function with integrated noise
   - Deterministic dynamics (linear + nonlinear + ENSO terms)
   - **SeasonalNoiseEmbedding**: Time-dependent noise generation

2. **SeasonalNoiseEmbedding**: 
   - **Seasonal noise amplitude**: Learnable parameters `seasonal_noise_amp[state_dim, ncycle]`
   - **Noise pattern network**: Neural network that generates time-dependent noise patterns
   - **Random sampling**: Gaussian noise scaled by learned patterns

3. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Uses Euler method with small time steps (required for stochastic stability)
   - Noise sampled at each integration step
   - Different random seeds for ensemble members

## 🎲 **Stochastic Features**

### **Time-Dependent Noise**:
```python
# Seasonal amplitude (learnable)
seasonal_amp = self.seasonal_noise_amp[:, cycle_idx]

# Time-dependent pattern (neural network)
noise_pattern = self.noise_embed_net(time_input)

# Combined noise vector
noise_vector = random_noise * (seasonal_amp * noise_pattern)
```

### **Controllable Stochasticity**:
- **`enable_noise`**: Can switch between deterministic/stochastic modes
- **`noise_scale`**: Global scaling of noise amplitude
- **Ensemble generation**: Different random seeds for each member

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **Training** (Deterministic for Stability):
```bash
python train.py --model_type stochastic --n_epochs 50 --batch_size 16
```

### **Stochastic Simulation**:
```python
# Ensemble simulation with noise
stochastic_sim = model.simulate(
    x0_data=initial_conditions,
    nyear=10,
    ncopy=100,           # 100 ensemble members
    enable_noise=True,   # Enable stochastic forcing
    noise_scale=0.1      # Control noise amplitude
)

# Deterministic simulation
deterministic_sim = model.simulate(
    x0_data=initial_conditions,
    nyear=10,
    ncopy=1,
    enable_noise=False   # Deterministic mode
)
```

### **Stochastic Forecasting**:
```python
# Probabilistic forecasts
forecasts = model.reforecast(
    init_data=initialization_data,
    n_month=21,
    ncopy=50,            # 50-member ensemble
    enable_noise=True,   # Stochastic forecasting
    noise_scale=0.05     # Reduced noise for forecasting
)
```
